# KNN-and-Artificial-Neural-Network

#### 1. The project has the classification techniques on two data sets from UCI Machine Learning repository namely 'SGEMM GPU kernel performance Data Set' and 'Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set Data Set'
#### 2. Classification techniques include KNN and Artificial Neural Networks.
#### 3. K nearest neighbour was used with experimentation with various values of K.
#### 4. In ANN, various infrastructures were designed while experimenting with activation functions like Relu, Sigmoid, Tanh etc. Also, exploration on the number of layers and number of nodes in hidden layer were key to achieve maximum exporation with respect to other classification techniques.
